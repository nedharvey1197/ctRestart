The affected balance capacity may cause walking disturbances, falls and decreased mobility. Balance may be improved by physical therapy. A possible method for balance training is body awareness therapy, that was introduced in Sweden by Jacques Dropsy and Gertrud Roxendal. Earlier body awareness therapy was mostly used in psychiatric care but in the recent years the method has been used for people with long-tern pain, amputations and multiple sclerosis. Body awareness therapy includes exercises in lying, sitting and standing. Focus of the exercises are awareness of oneÂ´s movement behaviour, breathing patterns, resources and limitations. Postural control is an essential part in the exercises. Body awareness therapy could be used for people with stroke as a way to improve postural control.

NCT06668220,Effect of Adding Different Concentrations of Dexmedetomidine to Bupivacaine in Caudal Block for Pediatrics,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06668220,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Pain is one of the medical problems frequently misdiagnosed, undertreated, and poorly under-stood, particularly in children.Poor pain management during childhood may have long-term deleterious impacts, including damaging neuro-endocrine reactions, disturbed eating and sleeping pat-terns, and increased pain sensitivity during subsequent painful events.

A caudal epidural block is a common regional analgesic technique in pediatric surgery . It is a time-tested, safe, and efficacious technique However, the duration of post-operative pain seen with much pediatric surgery (\>24 h) outlasts the duration of analgesia afforded by a standard 'local-anesthetics only' caudal block (4-12 h) While continuous catheters prolong analgesic duration, such techniques are more cumbersome, require significant technical expertise and may be associated with higher adverse events. Contrary to this, adding adjuvants to local anesthetic is an appealing alternative. Adjuvants can improve the block and analgesic duration , reduce general anesthetic or local anesthetic requirements, allow for smoother emergence, lower incidence of emergence delirium, and facilitate early discharge in ambulatory surgery.

Various adjuvants have been shown to enhance caudal blocks with varying degrees of success. A multitude of clinical trials and meta-analyses have analyzed the efficacy of different adjuvants such as alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and dexmedetomidine ), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (ketamine and magnesium ), opioids (fentanyl, morphine, and tramadol ), corticosteroids (dexamethasone ), and acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (neostigmine).

Dexmedetomidine has become more popular as a caudal adjuvant in children; it is a highly selective Î±2 agonist with sedative and analgesic properties. Dexmedetomidine possesses anxiolytic, sedative, sympatholytic, and analgesic properties without respiratory depressant effects In addition; dexmedetomidine has the ability to reduce both the anesthetic and opioid analgesic requirements during the perioperative period.",NO,Caudal Block for Postoperative Analgesia,DRUG: Dexmedetomidine|DRUG: Bupivacain,"The duration of analgesia, baseline and 24 hours","Total analgesic consumption, baseline and 24 hours|any neurological adverse effects, baseline and 24 hours",,Assiut University,,MALE,CHILD,PHASE1,50,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",caudal block for pediatrics,2024-11-20,2026-10-30,2026-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-11-13,,
