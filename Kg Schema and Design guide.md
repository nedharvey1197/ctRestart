# Clinical Trial Knowledge Graph Management System

This comprehensive knowledge graph architecture enables AI-powered clinical trial optimization through an intelligent copilot system that maintains persistent contextual awareness and supports evidence-based decision making.

The system leverages a three-layer architecture:
- Meta-Schema Layer for schema registry and version control
- Core Support Schema Layer for dynamic capabilities and intelligence
- Baseline Implementation Layer for foundational trial structure

## Copilot Integration

The architecture enables an AI copilot to:
- Maintain persistent trial knowledge through integrated schema relationships
- Process real-time updates across internal and external contexts
- Generate insights through pattern recognition and signal detection
- Support both strategic and operational decision-making
- Adapt knowledge based on new evidence and changing conditions

## Key Capabilities

The integrated schema structure provides:
- Real-time state awareness through the Trial State Tracking Schema
- Contextual intelligence via internal and external context monitoring
- Decision support through impact assessment and risk monitoring
- Knowledge integration across multiple evidence sources
- Signal generation for proactive risk and opportunity identification

This design document details the complete schema specifications, implementation guidelines, and management procedures needed to develop and maintain an intelligent clinical trial optimization platform. The following sections provide comprehensive documentation of each architectural layer and its components.

# Clinical Trial Knowledge Graph Management System Design

A comprehensive knowledge graph architecture supporting clinical trial optimization through interconnected layers.

## Schema Notation Conventions

**Baseline Implementation Layer**
- Uses conceptual notation for relationships
- Simple naming convention: `entity_relates_to_entity`
- Entity properties listed as {attribute_name, attribute_type}
- Example: `study_uses_intervention`, `Study {id, name, phase, status}`

**Core Support Schema Layer**
- Uses Neo4j-specific implementation notation
- Relationship syntax: `[:RELATIONSHIP_NAME] {property1, property2}`
- Explicit source and target entity definitions
- Example: `[:INFLUENCES_PERFORMANCE] {impact_type, confidence} - between MarketCondition and SitePerformance`

## Layer Functionality Distinctions

**Baseline Implementation Layer**
- Provides foundational trial structure
- Defines basic entity types and relationships
- Maintains core trial metadata
- Supports basic querying and data management

**Core Support Schema Layer**
- Enables advanced analytical capabilities
- Supports real-time monitoring and decision support
- Implements complex relationship properties
- Facilitates pattern recognition and signal generation

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of three primary layers:
- Meta-Schema Layer (Schema Registry)
- Core Support Schema Layer
- Baseline Implementation Layer

### Meta-Schema Layer

**Schema Registry Functions**
- Manages five core schemas
- Controls versioning and evolution
- Maintains validation rules
- Implements cross-schema relationship management

## Baseline Implementation Layer (BIL)

### BIL Study-Related Entities
- Study {id, name, phase, status}
- Protocol {id, version, status, type}
- StudyArm {id, name, intervention_type}
- EventGroup {id, name, type, criteria}
- OutcomeGroup {id, name, metrics}

### BIL Clinical Entities
- Condition {id, name, icd_code}
- Intervention {id, name, type, mechanism}
- Biomarker {id, name, measurement_type}
- AdverseEvent {id, type, severity, causality}
- PatientPopulation {id, characteristics, size}

### BIL Relationship Types
- study_uses_intervention
- study_targets_condition
- study_enrolls_population
- drug_affects_target
- condition_involves_organ
- precedes_event
- follows_milestone

## Core Support Schema Layer

### Trial State Tracking (TST) Schema

- Milestone {id, name, target_date, actual_date, status}
- PerformanceMetric {id, metric_type, value, timestamp}
- RiskIndicator {id, risk_type, severity, probability}
- ResourceUtilization {id, resource_type, quantity, allocation}

**TST Relationships**
- [:TRANSITIONS_TO] {timestamp, reason}
- [:DEPENDS_ON] {criticality, lag_time}
- [:IMPACTS] {effect_size, confidence}

CREATE INDEX FOR (m:Milestone) ON (m.target_date);
```

    def sync_schemas(self):
        # Synchronize schema components
        pass
    
    def validate_relationships(self):
        # Validate cross-schema relationships
        pass
```

## Quality Management

### Validation Rules
- Required field validation
