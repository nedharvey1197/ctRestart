# Development Environment Types Compared

## Environment
- Definition: Software and settings on a machine
- Examples:
  * Node.js + npm packages
  * Python + pip packages
  * Environment variables
  * OS-level dependencies
- Problems:
  * Different between developers
  * "Works on my machine"
  * Hard to replicate exactly
  * OS dependencies vary

## Workspace
- Definition: Project organization structure
- Contains:
  * Source code
  * Configuration files
  * Dependencies list
  * Build scripts
- Purpose:
  * Organize code
  * Development setup
  * Project configuration
  * Local development

## Repository
- Definition: Version-controlled code storage
- Contains:
  * Source code history
  * Branch management
  * Collaboration tools
  * Project documentation
- Purpose:
  * Code versioning
  * Team collaboration
  * Change tracking
  * Code distribution

## Container
- Definition: Packaged runtime environment
- Contains:
  * Application code
  * Runtime (Node.js/Python)
  * Dependencies
  * Configuration
  * OS-level libraries
- Key Differences:
  * Self-contained execution
  * Guaranteed consistency
  * Runs identically everywhere
  * Includes OS-level components
  * Resource isolation
  * Portable between systems

## Example:
Our Project:
- Repository: Code on GitHub
- Workspace: Local development folder
- Environment: Node.js setup on your machine
- Container Would Be: Complete packaged application
  * Node.js runtime
  * All dependencies
  * Configuration
  * Ready to run anywhere
