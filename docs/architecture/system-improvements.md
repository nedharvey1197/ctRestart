# System Improvements & Architecture Evolution

## Current Challenges & Proposed Solutions

### 1. Search Quality & Query Intelligence

#### Current Issues
- Over-inclusive results (29 vs actual 10 for Terns)
- Poor relevance filtering (5/29 truly relevant)
- Limited search parameters (company name only)

#### Proposed Improvements

##### A. Enhanced Search Strategy
- Multi-parameter query construction
- Relevance scoring system
- Company relationship validation
- Synonym/alias management

##### B. AI-Driven Query Generation
- OpenAPI-based query builder
- Self-learning query optimization
- Copilot-guided search refinement
- Model-based relevance training

##### C. Search Infrastructure
- Query template system
- Result validation pipeline
- Source credibility scoring
- Relationship strength metrics

### 2. Knowledge Graph Integration

##### A. Multi-Layer Schema
- Entity relationships
- Data lineage tracking
- Temporal relationships
- Contextual metadata

##### B. Storage Architecture
- Graph-native storage
- Relationship-based queries
- Versioned relationships
- Hierarchical metadata

##### C. ETL Framework
- Source-aware transformations
- Relationship preservation
- Context retention
- Provenance tracking

### 3. Service Data Meshing

##### A. Unified Processing
- Source-aware data integration
- Batch relationship processing
- Cross-source entity resolution
- Unified validation pipeline

##### B. Data Lineage
- Source reference preservation
- Process tracking
- Transformation history
