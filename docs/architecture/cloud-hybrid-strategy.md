# Cloud & Hybrid Architecture Strategy

## Current Architecture Assessment
- Local development (Frontend)
- MongoDB (Document storage)
- Compute-intensive analytics
- Growing knowledge graph needs

## Proposed Hybrid Architecture

### Local Components
1. Frontend Development
   - React application
   - Development tools
   - Testing environment
   - UI/UX iterations

2. Light Compute Services
   - Basic data processing
   - Query building
   - Result visualization
   - Development APIs

### Cloud Components

1. Data Storage
```
Neo4j AuraDB (Graph)  <-->  MongoDB Atlas (Documents)
         ↑                           ↑
         |                           |
    Graph Queries                Document Queries
         |                           |
    Knowledge Graph            Trial Data/Analytics
```

2. Compute Services
- ML/Analytics Pipeline
  * PlaNet models
  * Trial predictions
  * Population analysis
  * Embedding generation

3. Knowledge Graph Infrastructure
- CTKG Integration
- Entity Resolution
- Relationship Processing
- Similarity Computation

## Database Strategy

### MongoDB Atlas
- Purpose:
  * Trial data storage
  * Company profiles
  * Analytics results
  * Historical data
- Benefits:
  * Familiar interface
  * Easy migration
  * Scalable storage
  * Managed service

### Neo4j AuraDB
- Purpose:
  * Knowledge graph storage
  * Entity relationships
  * Graph queries
  * Embeddings storage
- Benefits:
  * Native graph operations
  * CYPHER query language
  * Visualization tools
  * Cloud-native scaling

## Implementation Phases

   - Integration testing

### Phase 2: Compute Migration
1. Analytics Pipeline
   - Container setup
   - Service deployment
   - Queue system
   - Monitoring

2. ML Models
   - GPU instances
   - Model deployment
   - Prediction APIs
   - Performance tuning

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph Integration

   - Graph migration
   - Entity mapping
   - Relationship import
   - Query adaptation

2. PlaNet Integration
   - Model deployment
   - Prediction setup
   - Data pipeline
   - API endpoints

## Cost Considerations
1. Storage
   - MongoDB Atlas: Pay per GB
   - AuraDB: Graph size based
   - Backup storage
   - Network transfer

2. Compute
   - ML instance hours
   - GPU usage
