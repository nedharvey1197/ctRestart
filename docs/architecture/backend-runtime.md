# Backend Runtime Analysis

## Current Setup (Node.js/Express)
- JavaScript/TypeScript backend
- NPM package management
- Express web framework
- MongoDB native drivers

## Alternative (Python/FastAPI/Uvicorn)
- Python backend
- FastAPI framework
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- Better ML/Analytics support

## Comparison

### Node.js Advantages
1. Same language as frontend
2. Native JSON handling
3. Large npm ecosystem
4. Easy MongoDB integration

### Python/Uvicorn Advantages
1. Better ML library support
2. Native integration with:
   - CTKG
   - PlaNet
   - PyTrials
3. Faster data processing
4. Better async performance

## Migration Considerations
Moving to Python/FastAPI would require:
1. Rewriting backend services
2. New database connectors
3. API restructuring
4. Development workflow changes

## Recommendation
Given our plans to integrate ML and graph analytics:
1. Consider gradual migration to Python/FastAPI
2. Start with new ML/Analytics services
3. Keep existing Node.js for now
4. Use API gateway to manage both
